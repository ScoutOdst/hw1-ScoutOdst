This will be distributed through Github Classroom.
Please fill in your name, and make sure your
code is executable. Each answer should show up properly

# PROBLEM ONE: Create variables for each data type listed, and print as a demo.
print("")ff
print("------------------- Homework One: ------------------")
myname = "PUT YOUR NAME HERE"
print("My name is: ", myname)
print ("Problem one: ..... ..... ..... .....")

# Boolean
b = True
print(b, "is type", type(b))


# List

# integer

# float

# string



# PROBLEM TWO: Show the use of each of: +, -, *, **, /, //, % with numbers.
print("")
print ("Problem two: ..... ..... ..... .....")

a,b =5,9

print(a, '+', b, '=', a+b)  #This demonstrates +




# PROBLEM THREE: Use the range command and other skills to find the
#                sum of odd integers between 1003 and 30239 inclusive.
print("")
print ("Problem three: ..... ..... ..... .....")

# Example: Sum of even integers between 8 and 20 inclusive:
print("Sum of evens between 8 and 20: ", sum(range(8,21,2)))



# PROBLEM FOUR: Create a list of 10 strings. Then, print out the third and
#               seventh items.
print("")
print ("Problem four: ..... ..... ..... .....")


#Example: Here, I create a list of 5 integers and print the 4th one.
L=[3,5,2,0,1]
print("My list: ",L)
print("The fourth item in my list is: ", L[3])
